      <p>Nanda, the half-brother of the Buddha, was affianced to Janapadakalyānī (or married to Sundarī), when the Buddha, by a stratagem, met him at Nyagrodhārāma, near Kapilavastu, and had him forcibly ordained by Ānanda. The memory of his wife continued to haunt Nanda who tried to escape from the monastery. His attempt failed miserably. To cure him of this love, the Buddha transported him to the Trāyastriṃśa gods and showed him the celestial maidens incomparably more beautiful than Janapadakalyāyanī; he promised him one of these maidens if he would undertake to remain in the monastery for the rest of his life. Nanda agreed willingly. The Buddha returned with him to the Jetavāna and told the whole story to the disciples: Nanda was obliged to endure the sarcasm of his colleagues. He succeeded in renouncing his love and quickly became arhat. In the course of an earlier lifetime when he had been a donkey, Nanda had been kept harnessed up by his master, the merchant Kappata, who had promised him a female donkey as reward.The story of Nanda is one of the best-known of the “Golden Legends” in Buddhism. The artists of Andhra who have depicted it at Nāgārjunikoṇḍa and at Amarāvatī – probably Nāgārjuna’s homeland – had a marked preference for it. – It is easy to reconstruct it in its entirety by comparing the different sources where it is recorded in full or in part:</p>
